People have become homeless because of:
Mental illness such as schizophrenia. 20 to 25% of all homeless people have severe mental illness. Studies have found that there is a correlation between homelessness and incarceration.
Materials abuse. Materials abuse is probably the most common cause of homelessness, because in a survey that was made in 2008, 68% of states recorded that substance abuse was the single largest cause of homelessness for single adults. Substance abuse was also seen by 12% of states as the third most common cause of homelessness among families.
Running away from home. According to Missed Opportunities: Youth Homelessness in America(link is external), around one in 10 young adults ages 18 to 25 and at least one in 30 youth ages 13 to 17 experienced unaccompanied homelessness within a 12-month period. This equates to an estimated 4.2 million youth and young adults in the U.S., about the same as the population of Los Angeles or the combined populations of Houston, TX, Seattle, WA, Washington, DC, and Atlanta, GA. The same report(link is external) also found that 72% of homeless youth who slept on the streets or in shelters also couch surfed. And more than 40% of surveyed youth experienced more than one episode of homelessness during the year, with 73% experiencing an episode longer than one month. The National Center for Homeless Education found that the number of unaccompanied homeless students increased by nearly 26% between the 2013-2014 and 2015-2016 school years. The National Runaway Safeline (NRS), the federally designated national runaway and homeless youth crisis hotline and online service, responded to 29,841 calls, chats, emails, and web postings in 2017. It is estimated that 6 to 7% of youth run away from home each year ? more than 1.5 million children and adolescents annually.1 NRS? report, Why They Run, indicates that issues cited by youth as reasons for leaving home include family dynamics; physical, sexual, verbal, and other types of abuse; and economic issues at home. The study also found that almost half of the youth interviewed said they were forced out of their homes. Youth homelessness is almost as common in rural areas as urban areas. The Voices of Youth Count findings make it clear that homelessness among young people is not only an urban issue(link is external) ? 9.2% of youth in rural counties reported experiencing any homelessness; the prevalence for urban youth was 9.6%.
